# Introduction

Welcome Flat Rate Metal Admin Portal (AP) Documentation! This is a living project where we will key you into the latest features and capabilities of the AP. If you would like to contribute to the documentation or notify us of a correction that needs to be made please reach out to Matthew Lefevre.

## Documentation Summary

The documentation has been created to be a reference and training guide for new and existing team members. Here is a brief summary of the different kinds of items you will be working with:

1. **Users** - users represent humans that interacti with the system. They are composed of a lot of different information including login. There are 3 types of users `ADMIN`, `BUSINESS`, and `RETAIL`.
2. **Orders** - orders represent an intent to purchase products by a specific user. There are 3 types of orders `BUSINESS`, `RETAIL`, and `GUEST`.
3. **Products** - products are items that can be purchased through the app or website.
4. **Base Products** - base products are collections of similar products (ie: storm grey aluminum drip edge, adobe tan aluminum drip edge, etc...).
5. **Categories** - Categories are groups of products and base products. They are a bit more broad than base products and can be nested as sub categories.
6. **Companies** - companies are groups of `BUSINESS` users that benefit from additional options and pricing flexibility. Companies can be either `DEALER` or `CONTRACTOR` type.

:::caution

The words **Company** and **Business** are often used synonymously throughout this documentation. Ideally we would only use one of these words. We are working on addressing this. This will require coding changes that will have to be resoved at a later date.
