# Make A New Team Member Badge

Badges are an important element of our brand they convey professionalism. If possible alert individuals your are taking their picture ahead of time so they can prepare to look their best on the badge.

Find a wall or door with a consistent background color and good lighting. I find the walls in Dry It Center Good. Take the team members picture from a modest distance capturing them from about the waist up.

To remove the background and place the picture on the badge please watch the content video.
